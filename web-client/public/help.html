            <h3>What game is this?</h3>
            This game is an adaption of a board game called <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game)">Labyrinth</a></cite>.
            The rules follow the rules of the original game, with the notable exception that all players have the same objective.
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>What is the objective?</h3>
            Move your piece <svg class="inline"><use xlink:href="#player-piece" /></svg> through the labyrinth and reach the objective <svg class="inline"><use xlink:href="#objective" /></svg>.
            You can play alone, trying to find the minimum number of moves to reach the <svg class="inline"><use xlink:href="#objective" /></svg>.
            You can also play against others and prevent them from reaching the <svg class="inline"><use xlink:href="#objective" /></svg>.
            The pathways of the labyrinth are altered at each player's turn.
        </section>

            <h3>What do I have to do?</h3>
            When it is your turn to play (as marked by the green box in the score board), you need to perform two actions:
            <ul>
                <li>First, rearrange the labyrinth.
                    To do so, drag the maze cards along a row or column. Every second row and column is draggable.
                    This action inserts the leftover maze card.
                    You can also rotate leftover before inserting it.</li>
                <li>Then move your piece, by clicking on a maze card connected to your current position. The available cards are marked with your color.</li>
            </ul>
            The no-pushback rule disallows reverting the previous player's shift.
            When the <svg class="inline"><use xlink:href="#objective" /></svg> is reached, a new objective location is chosen randomly.
